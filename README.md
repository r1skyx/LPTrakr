# LPTrakr

**LPTrakr** is a personal project to help me keep track of albums I've listened to, rate/review them, and organize albums I want to listen to in the future. The app also aims to provide recommendations and allow me to manage my listening history.

## Features (Planned)
- Track albums I've listened to and rate/review them.
- Create a "listen list" for albums I want to hear in the future.
- Implement album recommendations, possibly using AI or the Last.fm API.
- User authentication to manage personal data.
- **PWA (Progressive Web App)** in the final version.
  
## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vue.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core
- **Database**: MySQL

## Current Status
This project is in the early stages of development. More features will be added in the future as I continue to build it out.
